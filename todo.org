** TODO Tasks [0/5]
*** TODO decide on unary operator
currently all operators can be unary operators, and when used in a
pipe expression they will behave as binary expressions with the pipe
left expression, this leads to confusing parsing precedence, and the
feature is questionable
*** TODO add bitwize operator [0/2]
- [ ] bitshift operators
- [ ] bitwize and, or and xor
*** TODO add multiline strings
a la zig (leading character on every line) similar to how comments work
*** TODO figure out trailing closure syntax
*** TODO figure out generics systax
might consier using different syntax for definition and calling convention
** notes
- destinction between =[]= and =()=
  - =[]= create types, while =()= create tuples
    while compound types are technically a tuple of types, the
    distinction is in how the object is treated

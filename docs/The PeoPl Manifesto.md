# The Peopl Manifesto

## Preface

In his Discourse on the Method, French philosopher Rene Descartes
attempts to arrive to a set of principles that one can know as true without any doubt.

In his Meditations on First Philosophy, he establishes the thought experiment;
Imagine you have a basket of apples where you suspect some of them are rotten.
To prevent the rot from spreading, you remove all apples from the basket.
You then examine all apples, one by one, and only put back the ones that are good.

In the same way, I tried to reevaluate every programming concept, syntax and idioms.

Computer science and programming are relatively still an immature field. A young science.
Compared to other engineering fields, like mechanical engineering that has millennia of history,
or chemical engineering that has centuries of history, software engineering only has decades of history.

Despite being this young it is one of the most growing fields, launching the digital revolution.

A subset of software engineering and computer science is the building of the tools themselves,
that are used as infrastructure for building other software.

Programming languages, their design and their usages, is a subset of that subset.
Being a young field, we still haven't figured it out yet. We still debate over the best web framework,
we still go to war over formatting rules, tabs vs spaces, curly braces vs significant whitespace,
object oriented programming vs functional, imperative vs declarative, statically typed vs dynamically typed,
SQL vs noSQL, memory safety vs performance. We still have vague metrics like readability, maintainability,
safe, robust. Programming is considered a science yet we still argue over subjective matters.
New tools pops every couple of years, new concepts become obsolete every release cycle.
We have a proliferation of tools that all do basically the same thing.

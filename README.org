* The Language Overview
This is a [[file:docs/small_overview.org][small overview]], a more [[file:docs/overview.org][comprehensive overview]] is not complete

* The Manifesto
Check the  [[file:docs/TheManifesto.org][the manifesto]] , AI helped me write it

* Why
Just for fun.

But also a thought experiment.
An opinionated programming language that fits my programming style.

* Installation
You can't install it right now

** Build it
Make sure you have swift installed. Compile it with spm.

* What's available
- A tree sitter grammar for syntax highlighting in your editor (needs manual configuration)
- An lsp (that doesn't work)
- Compiler with LLVM as backend (still WIP)

* State
Ok nothing is ready, if you find this repo by mistake, just know that nothing is ready.
